what is replication in MongoDB ?
Replication in MongoDB involves creating multiple copies of data across different servers, known as replica sets.

*******************************
what is HOC ?
HOC means higher order components.
HOC is an access the parameter one components & return one components.


*******************************
why use HOC ?
common the logic  of the component is not belong to the component. so we use HOC. 

*******************************
function component & class component ?
function component is an updated  version of class component. function component is more faster than class component.
class component is use react life cycle method & function component is use for react hooks. 

*******************************
What is the purpose of ExpressJS ?
The purpose of ExpressJS is to provide a flexible and lightweight framework for building web applications. It allows
developers to create web servers, handle HTTP requests and responses, and connect to databases.

*******************************
virtual DOM in react ?
Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. It is used by React to optimize
rendering and improve performance. When the state of the application changes, React updates the virtual DOM
and then efficiently updates the real DOM by comparing the two and only making the necessary changes.
work for the comparing it is known as a diffing-algorithm


*******************************
What is middleware in Node.js and how is it used ?
middleware is an middleman  between the request & response and main  purpose of middleware is to perform some
task before the request is passed to the next middleware or the final handler.do not load direct server using middleware.

*******************************
Explain the event loop in Node JS.
if suppose user send a request an server, this request store in task queue, and it working on FIFO(first in first out)method.
when the event loop is free, it take one task from the task queue and execute it and after it will be check request is an async or sync.    

*******************************
What are node JS streams ? 
streams are 4 part :  readable, writable, duplex, transform.

*******************************
react life-cycle-method ? 
main 3 parts in react-life-cycle. i)mounting ii)updating iii)unmounting.
i)mounting : 
    constructor ->  getDerivedStateFromProps -> render -> componentDidMount
ii)updating : 
    getDerivedStateFromProps ->  shouldComponentUpdate -> render -> getSnapshotBeforeUpdate -> componentDidUpdate
iii)unmounting : 
    componentDidUnmount

*******************************
what is redux ?
redux is an state management at a top-level element. first of all create a store and configure the store after that createSlices.
And select a value use the useSelector.
do not changes direct change in redux, so for this purpose we use dispatch hook.


*******************************
what is MongoDB ? how does differ from SQL database ?
MongoDB is an database,  it is a NoSQL database. it is a document based database.
different because  of SQL database is table based database. in SQL database we use query language for query data.

*******************************
Can you explain what a document is in MongoDB?
A document in MongoDB is a collection of key-value pairs. like JSON.
eg : 
    {
  "_id": ObjectId("603c9f1a2f1a2c001f8b4567"),
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30,
  "hobbies": ["reading", "traveling"],
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "surat",
    "zip": "12345"
  }
    }

*******************************
What are some common aggregation methods in MongoDB?
Some common aggregation methods in MongoDB are: 
    i)match : filter the data
    ii)group :  group the data
    iv)sort :  sort the data
    v)limit :   limit the data
    vi)skip : skip the data.


     

*******************************
what is ExpressJS ? why use is MERN stack ?
ExpressJS is a Node.js web framework for building web applications and APIs. It is a lightweight.
most up developer use in ExpressJS, because  it is easy to use and fast. and it is a free and open-source.

*******************************
Can you explain middleware in Express? Provide an example.
Middleware in Express is a function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (
    res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is
    typically accessed using the `next()` function.
    example :
    app.use("/login" , loginValidation , login)
    this example loginValidation is an middleware.


*******************************
How do you handle error management in Express.js?
Error management in Express.js can be handled using the following methods :
i)try-catch block
ii)error handling middleware

*******************************
What are the key features of React?
key is an special object.  it is used to keep track of the component state.
if i am use for a generally loop for out code.
then we use map() function. and if we use for a generally loop for out code.
this time i will use the key.


*******************************
http status code ? 
100 - 199 -> informational  response
200 - 299 ->  success
300 - 399 ->  redirect
400 - 499 ->  client error
500 - 599 -> server error

200 - ok status code
201 - ok but send a request(signUp,login) 
400 - bad request status code
401 - Unauthorized
500 - server error

*******************************
what is pure component in react ?
Pure component is a component that does not change its state when the props change.
it is a component that is used when the props are not changing.
and use for only class component,  not for functional component.
but use for in function component i have use memo() hook in react.

*******************************
useActionState () hook in react ?
Pass an asynchronous function to useActionState that performs a specific action, like fetching data or submitting a form.
Use the returned state variables and action trigger (loading, error, result, and triggerAction) in your component.
after ui change

*******************************
useOptimistic () hook in react ?
The useOptimistic hook is useful when you want to immediately update the UI based on user actions, before waiting for a response from an asynchronous operation (like an API call), and then revert the update if the operation fails.
first ui change

*******************************
difference between useActionState & useOptimistic hook ?
UI Update : 
    useActionState = UI changes after the async operation completes
    useOptimistic = UI changes immediately, before the async operation completes
State Returned : 
    useActionState = loading, data, error
    useOptimistic = state, loading, error, optimisticAction
